First off, Thank You for signing up for our event! Can't wait to see you there!

Due to our campus's slow wifi, we ask if you can install the necessariy programs before the event! 
(Docker takes about 18 minutes to download on campus!)

First, Make a Docker Hub account. (Docker Hub is a registry of Docker images. You can think of the registry as a directory of all available Docker images.)
http://mlhlocal.host/docker-hub


Enter your email and choose a Docker ID and password for your account.  Youâ€™ll be asked to verify your email address before being able to log in though.

Second Install Docker on your desktop.
Mac:
http://mlhlocal.host/docker-mac

PC:
http://mlhlocal.host/docker-windows

Linux:
http://mlhlocal.host/docker-linux

Third, Install Node.js (Node.js is an environment that runs JavaScript code on the server-side.)

Mac: 
http://mlhlocal.host/node-mac

PC:
http://mlhlocal.host/node-pc

Linux:
http://mlhlocal.host/node-linux


Fourth, Dowload the Zip file of the app. We will be going through this the day of. 
http://mlhlocal.host/quorum-app


Note there are more things we will be installing but we will do those the day of!
